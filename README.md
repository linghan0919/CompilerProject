# CompilerProject
This is a course project of Compiler Principles. The project is divided into two parts:

1. Implement a simplified compiler front-end including a lexical analyzer and a syntax analyzer with the tool Flex and Yacc;
2. Implement a code generator which returns a LLVM assembly program.

In the project, the source language is Small-C, a C-like language containing a subset of the C programming language; while the target code is LLVM instructions that can be run on LLVM. 
More details can be found in attached Report.pdf.
